# Just having a little fun makin' some clocks in react

## Notes:
I started this project a while back and got busy with work. I wanted to go ahead and finish it so I could push it to github, because I was silly and didn't commit regularly on this project. 

Mostly just did it because I wanted to see if I could update css using state in React. Needless to say you can, and I did so umm....yay programmering!! 👨‍💻 👻
